# mobile_price_prediction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project focused on predicting mobile prices based on key specifications. The dataset includes features like battery power, internal memory, RAM, talk time, and indicators for the presence of a touch screen, WiFi, 3G, 4G, and Bluetooth.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between features and visualized key patterns in the data.
Model Implementation: Utilized logistic regression, support vector classifier, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and gradient boosting algorithms for predicting mobile prices.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy scores, with the gradient boosting classifier achieving a notable score of 0.92.
Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the project's objectives, methodology, and results.
